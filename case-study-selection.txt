Adopting Microservices at Netflix: Lessons for Team and Process DesignFormer Director of Web Engineering and then Cloud Architect, Adrian Cockcroft oversaw the companyâ€™s transition from a traditional development model with 100 engineers producing a monolithic DVD-rental application to a microservices architecture with many small teams responsible for the end-to-end development of hundreds of microservices that work together to stream digital entertainment to millions of Netflix customers every day.
Your case study is to learn what Adrian Cockcroft says (via videos/blogs) and did for Netflix from a Team and Process design perspective.

I want to research the transition that took place at Netflix to learn more about why the team there found it so neccesary. At some point the decision was made to move from a monolithic swamp to a microservice architecture and clearly it has worked brilliant for Netflix. I want to learn about why this transition became paramount and furthermore how the team did this without sacrificing functionality (things seem to have always worked at netflix).
